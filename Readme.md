Work Day Scheduler Assignment

This project provides the user with a simple, easy to use calender to keep their day nice and organized. The time stamp at the top of the page will display the current time, and the colors indicated on the schedule itself will tell the user if and when certain times/task have past, or they are current or if they are future.
Green will tell the user time/task is in the future
White will tell the user time/task is current
Gray will tell the user the time/task has passed
User will also be able to save tasks throughout the day, with out worrying about refreshing the page or losing any tasks they have written in. DON'T FORGET TO HIT SAVE!

We are just begining the use of APIs, I felt really good about this project. I really liked implementing moment.js into my code. I did get stuck with the color coding of my scheduler, and having the color match the past/present/current time. This bug I toyed with for hours, only to find out it was something very small, like the improper naming of a div in my HTML.
